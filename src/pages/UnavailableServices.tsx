                  Thank you for spending time exploring our site! We're deeply grateful for your interest in NSTM.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Owning a brand with zero experience and no real-world exposure, sounda crazy, right? From casually joking about launching our own food stall at RECHARGE'25 to hustling for stock, every step was a thrilling ride. Bunking classes didn't feel as cool as brainstorming at the front bench, turning our ideas into reality.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But none of this would have been possible without you, the amazing people of REC who stopped by, grabbed a bite and made our stall come alive. We never had a dull moment and special shoutout to those who kept coming back for more.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg font-medium text-primary/90 mt-6">
                  It's time to say a huge, heartfelt thank you for making this journey unforgettable. Until next time, it's NSTM here,¬†signing¬†off...
